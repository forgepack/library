/**
 * Contract for REST controllers that support advanced lifecycle operations
 * such as hard deletion and restoration of resources.
 *
 * <p>This interface is intended to be used as an optional extension to
 * {@link ControllerGeneric}, providing additional endpoints for managing
 * resource states beyond standard CRUD operations.</p>
 *
 * <p>These operations are typically applicable in systems that implement
 * soft delete strategies, where resources are logically removed but can
 * still be restored or permanently deleted.</p>
 *
 * <h3>Supported operations</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Permanently delete a resource (hard delete)</li>
 *     <li>Restore a previously deleted resource</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage considerations</h3>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>These operations may have security restrictions and should be protected accordingly</li>
 *     <li>Not all resources should expose these endpoints publicly</li>
 *     <li>Implementations should ensure consistency with the underlying data model</li>
 * </ul>
